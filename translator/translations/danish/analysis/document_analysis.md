## Summary

This essay argues that humanity stands at a critical juncture in AI development and must choose to prevent the creation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence to preserve human agency and civilization. The document is structured as a comprehensive analysis spanning 12 chapters plus appendices, beginning with an executive summary and moving through technical explanations of modern AI, definitions of AGI, current progress toward human-level AI, the forces driving the race to AGI, predicted consequences of building AGI, and finally a detailed proposal for preventing AGI development through compute governance, liability frameworks, and international cooperation.

The core argument follows a logical progression: current AI systems are approaching human-level capability across multiple domains; the triple intersection of high Autonomy, Generality, and Intelligence creates uniquely dangerous systems; building AGI would likely result in societal disruption, loss of human control, geopolitical conflict, and eventual human displacement; but AGI development can be prevented through coordinated governance measures including compute caps, enhanced liability, and safety regulation. The essay concludes by advocating for "Tool AI" that enhances rather than replaces human capability, emphasizing that this choice represents "keeping the future human" rather than ceding control to artificial systems.

The document combines technical AI concepts with policy analysis, risk assessment, and governance proposals, targeting both technical and policy audiences with its comprehensive treatment of AI safety, control problems, and regulatory solutions.
