## Summary

This essay presents a comprehensive argument against the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence, advocating instead for "closing the gates" to these technologies while pursuing safer "Tool AI" alternatives. The document is structured as a detailed policy proposal with technical appendices.

The core argument follows several key threads: AI systems fundamentally differ from traditional software through their unpredictability and opacity; current AI development is rapidly approaching human-level general intelligence through massive computational scaling; this trajectory poses existential risks including societal disruption, loss of human control, geopolitical conflict, and potential human extinction; and concrete governance measures can prevent these outcomes while preserving AI's benefits.

The author proposes a framework based on the "A-G-I" intersection of high Autonomy, Generality, and Intelligence as the danger zone requiring strictest controls. The solution involves compute governance (tracking and capping computational resources), enhanced liability frameworks, and tiered safety regulations. The essay concludes with a vision for beneficial "Tool AI" that enhances rather than replaces human capabilities.

The document combines technical analysis, policy proposals, and philosophical arguments about humanity's technological choices, targeting both technical and policy audiences with detailed implementation guidance in the appendices.

## Glossary

- **Source Term**: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- **Target Translation**: Intelligence artificielle générale (IAG)
- **Context**: Central concept throughout the document, referring to AI systems matching or exceeding human cognitive abilities across all domains
- **Notes**: Standard translation in French AI literature; maintains the acronym parallel (IAG)

- **Source Term**: superintelligence
- **Target Translation**: superintelligence
- **Context**: AI systems far exceeding human capabilities across all domains
- **Notes**: Term is widely used as-is in French AI discourse; translating as "super-intelligence" would be awkward

- **Source Term**: neural networks
- **Target Translation**: réseaux de neurones
- **Context**: The mathematical/computational structures underlying modern AI systems
- **Notes**: Standard established translation in French technical literature

- **Source Term**: compute / computation
- **Target Translation**: calcul / puissance de calcul
- **Context**: Refers to computational resources (FLOP) used in AI training and inference
- **Notes**: "Compute" as a noun is anglicism in French; "calcul" or "puissance de calcul" are more natural

- **Source Term**: FLOP (Floating-Point Operations)
- **Target Translation**: FLOP (opérations en virgule flottante)
- **Context**: Technical unit for measuring computational work
- **Notes**: Acronym commonly used as-is in French technical contexts; explanation in parentheses for clarity

- **Source Term**: training / inference
- **Target Translation**: entraînement / inférence
- **Context**: The two phases of AI development - learning from data vs. generating outputs
- **Notes**: Standard translations in French machine learning terminology

- **Source Term**: alignment
- **Target Translation**: alignement
- **Context**: Ensuring AI systems do what humans want them to do
- **Notes**: Direct cognate widely used in French AI safety literature

- **Source Term**: Tool AI
- **Target Translation**: IA-outil
- **Context**: AI systems designed to remain controllable tools rather than autonomous agents
- **Notes**: Hyphenated form follows French compound noun conventions; distinguishes from "outils d'IA"

- **Source Term**: autonomous agents
- **Target Translation**: agents autonomes
- **Context**: AI systems that can act independently without human oversight
- **Notes**: Direct translation; well-established in French AI literature

- **Source Term**: scaffolding
- **Target Translation**: architecture de support
- **Context**: Software frameworks that connect AI components and manage their interactions
- **Notes**: "Scaffolding" is metaphorical here; "architecture de support" captures the structural function better than literal "échafaudage"

- **Source Term**: chain-of-thought
- **Target Translation**: chaîne de raisonnement
- **Context**: AI technique allowing models to work through problems step-by-step
- **Notes**: Descriptive translation preserving the sequential reasoning concept

- **Source Term**: multimodal models
- **Target Translation**: modèles multimodaux
- **Context**: AI systems that process multiple types of data (text, images, audio)
- **Notes**: Standard translation in French AI literature

- **Source Term**: scaling laws
- **Target Translation**: lois d'échelle
- **Context**: Empirical relationships between computational input and AI capability
- **Notes**: Established term in French scientific literature across disciplines

- **Source Term**: liability / strict liability
- **Target Translation**: responsabilité / responsabilité objective
- **Context**: Legal framework holding AI developers accountable for harms
- **Notes**: "Responsabilité objective" is the French legal term for strict liability

- **Source Term**: safe harbor
- **Target Translation**: régime d'exonération
- **Context**: Legal protections from liability when meeting certain conditions
- **Notes**: "Safe harbor" is Anglo-American concept; "régime d'exonération" captures the legal protection function

- **Source Term**: compute caps / compute governance
- **Target Translation**: plafonds de calcul / gouvernance computationnelle
- **Context**: Proposed limits on computational resources used in AI development
- **Notes**: "Plafonds" clearly conveys the limiting function; "gouvernance computationnelle" maintains technical precision

- **Source Term**: hardware security / secure chips
- **Target Translation**: sécurité matérielle / puces sécurisées
- **Context**: Built-in chip features for controlling and monitoring AI computation
- **Notes**: Standard translations in French cybersecurity and hardware contexts
