## Summary

This comprehensive essay argues against the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence, proposing instead a governance framework to "close the gates" to these technologies while promoting safer "Tool AI" alternatives. The document is structured as a 10-chapter argument with appendices, moving from technical background through risk analysis to concrete policy proposals.

The core argument follows this progression: Current AI systems are rapidly approaching human-level general intelligence across multiple domains. The race toward AGI is driven by corporate competition for labor automation and national security concerns. However, AGI poses existential risks through power concentration, societal disruption, loss of human control, potential warfare, and inevitable progression to uncontrollable superintelligence. The essay proposes specific governance mechanisms including compute caps, enhanced liability frameworks, and international oversight to prevent AGI development while enabling beneficial AI applications that remain under human control.

The document targets both technical and policy audiences, combining scientific analysis of AI capabilities with detailed regulatory proposals. It emphasizes that preventing AGI is both technically feasible and politically necessary to preserve human agency and civilization.

## Glossary

- **Source Term**: AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
- **Target Translation**: AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
- **Context**: Central concept throughout - AI systems matching or exceeding human performance across all cognitive domains
- **Notes**: Widely used acronym in German AI discourse; translation "Künstliche Allgemeine Intelligenz" would be cumbersome

- **Source Term**: superintelligence
- **Target Translation**: Superintelligenz
- **Context**: AI systems far surpassing human capabilities across all domains
- **Notes**: Direct translation maintains clarity; established in German AI literature

- **Source Term**: compute
- **Target Translation**: Rechenleistung
- **Context**: Computational resources/power used in AI training and operation
- **Notes**: While "Compute" appears in German tech contexts, "Rechenleistung" is more accessible to broader audiences

- **Source Term**: neural networks
- **Target Translation**: neuronale Netzwerke
- **Context**: Mathematical/computational structures underlying modern AI
- **Notes**: Standard German technical translation

- **Source Term**: FLOP (floating-point operations)
- **Target Translation**: FLOP (Gleitkommaoperationen)
- **Context**: Unit of computational measurement for AI systems
- **Notes**: Acronym used internationally; parenthetical German explanation for clarity

- **Source Term**: training
- **Target Translation**: Training
- **Context**: Process of teaching AI systems through data and feedback
- **Notes**: "Training" widely used in German AI contexts; "Ausbildung" would be confusing

- **Source Term**: inference
- **Target Translation**: Inferenz
- **Context**: AI system generating outputs/predictions from inputs
- **Notes**: Technical term established in German AI literature

- **Source Term**: alignment
- **Target Translation**: Alignment
- **Context**: Ensuring AI systems do what humans want them to do
- **Notes**: No established German equivalent captures the technical meaning; "Ausrichtung" too broad

- **Source Term**: Tool AI
- **Target Translation**: Werkzeug-KI
- **Context**: Controllable AI systems that enhance rather than replace human capabilities
- **Notes**: Compound maintains conceptual clarity; "Tool AI" not standard in German

- **Source Term**: autonomous agents
- **Target Translation**: autonome Agenten
- **Context**: AI systems that can take actions independently
- **Notes**: Direct translation; both terms established in German

- **Source Term**: general-purpose AI (GPAI)
- **Target Translation**: Allzweck-KI
- **Context**: AI systems adaptable to various tasks
- **Notes**: Captures the versatility concept better than literal "allgemeine KI"

- **Source Term**: scaffolding
- **Target Translation**: Gerüstsystem
- **Context**: Software architecture connecting AI components
- **Notes**: Architectural metaphor translates well; "Scaffolding" not standard in German

- **Source Term**: chain-of-thought
- **Target Translation**: Chain-of-Thought
- **Context**: AI technique for multi-step reasoning
- **Notes**: Established technical term in German AI research; translation would lose precision

- **Source Term**: compute caps
- **Target Translation**: Rechenleistungsobergrenzen
- **Context**: Proposed limits on computational resources for AI development
- **Notes**: Descriptive compound noun typical in German policy language

- **Source Term**: liability
- **Target Translation**: Haftung
- **Context**: Legal responsibility for AI system harms
- **Notes**: Standard legal term in German jurisprudence

- **Source Term**: Gates
- **Target Translation**: Tore
- **Context**: Metaphorical barriers to dangerous AI development (key concept)
- **Notes**: Central metaphor of the essay; "Tore" maintains the metaphorical power

- **Source Term**: runaway
- **Target Translation**: Kontrollverlust
- **Context**: Uncontrolled AI self-improvement leading to superintelligence
- **Notes**: "Runaway" as borrowed term unclear; "Kontrollverlust" captures the core concern

- **Source Term**: red-teaming
- **Target Translation**: Red-Teaming
- **Context**: Adversarial testing of AI systems for vulnerabilities
- **Notes**: Military/security term adopted unchanged in German contexts
