## Summary

This comprehensive essay argues for preventing the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence while promoting safer "Tool AI" alternatives. The document is structured as a detailed academic argument spanning 12 chapters plus appendices, presenting both the risks of current AI development trajectories and concrete policy proposals to address them.

The core argument follows a logical progression: modern AI systems based on neural networks are rapidly approaching human-level general intelligence through massive computational scaling. The essay defines AGI through the "triple intersection" of high Autonomy, Generality, and Intelligence, arguing that systems combining all three properties pose existential risks to human civilization. These risks include societal disruption, loss of human control, potential warfare between nations racing for AI supremacy, and ultimately the replacement of humanity by artificial superintelligence.

The author contends this trajectory is not inevitable and proposes "closing the Gates" through specific governance measures: compute accounting and oversight, hard caps on AI training and inference computation, enhanced liability frameworks for dangerous systems, and tiered safety regulations. The essay advocates for developing "Tool AI" instead—powerful but controllable systems that enhance rather than replace human capabilities.

The document combines technical AI knowledge with policy analysis, game theory, and risk assessment, targeting both expert and general audiences. It concludes with a call for international cooperation to ensure AI remains a tool for human empowerment rather than replacement.
